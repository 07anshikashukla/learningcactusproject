This blog documents my ongoing journey of learning core system design concepts. Each post represents my understanding of a topic at the time of writing, built from first principles and refined through hands-on exploration. </p>

<p>The content here grows alongside my understanding. As I continue learning, I’ll add new posts and revisit ideas, gradually moving from fundamentals to cloud-specific implementations and real-world architectures.</p>


<p>This is the first post in a series where I document my understanding of core system design concepts as I learn them, focusing on fundamentals before exploring cloud-specific implementations.</p>
